Yes, that's essentially correct. With a well-designed architecture that

enforces proper separation of concerns, the frontend doesn't need to

know whether the backend data is coming from an algorithm-based system

or a machine learning-based system. The key is to abstract the data

retrieval process behind well-defined interfaces (such as APIs) so that

the data provider's internal workings are hidden from the consumer.



\section{Points to Consider}\label{points-to-consider}



\begin{itemize}

\item

  \textbf{Decoupling:}\\

  The frontend interacts with the backend through clearly defined

  contracts (e.g., RESTful APIs). This means it only needs to know the

  structure and format of the data, not how that data was produced.

\item

  \textbf{Flexibility:}\\

  Whether recommendations are generated via a rule-based algorithm or a

  machine learning model, as long as the output adheres to the

  agreed-upon data format, the frontend can render the information

  without modifications.

\item

  \textbf{Maintenance and Scalability:}\\

  Separation of concerns helps in isolating changes. If you decide to

  switch from one backend approach to another (e.g., moving from a

  heuristic-based system to a more complex ML model), you can do so

  without overhauling the entire system---provided the output remains

  consistent.

\item

  \textbf{Potential Caveats:}\\

  While the abstraction can mask the underlying complexity, there might

  be subtle differences in performance or data latency. For example, an

  ML-based system might require more computational time for generating

  personalized recommendations, which might necessitate adjustments in

  how the frontend handles loading states or data caching. However,

  these are engineering challenges that can be managed at the

  integration layer.

\end{itemize}



In summary, proper separation of concerns allows your system to be

flexible and maintainable, making the choice between algorithmic or ML

approaches mostly a backend concern, as long as the communication

contracts remain stable.
