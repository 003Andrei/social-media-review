### Heuristic-Based Recommendation System

**1. Architecture & Modularity**  
• **Modular Design:** Separate the recommendation engine from data ingestion, business logic, and presentation layers. This helps in maintaining and extending the system later (for instance, when integrating machine learning components).  
• **Configurable Rules:** Implement heuristic rules in a configuration file or a dedicated module. This way, updating the rules doesn't require redeploying the entire system, and it paves the way for a smoother transition when incorporating ML-based recommendations.

**2. Heuristic Rules & Scoring**  
• **Rule Definition:** Identify key factors (e.g., user behavior, item similarity, popularity) and codify them into rules. For example, “if a user has viewed similar items multiple times, boost the score for those items.”  
• **Weighted Scoring:** Assign weights to each rule to produce a composite recommendation score. This scoring mechanism allows for fine-tuning and easier debugging of the system’s outputs.

**3. Data Considerations**  
• **Data Preparation:** Establish a data pipeline that cleans and aggregates user interactions and item metadata. A well-defined data model will support both heuristic and future ML approaches.  
• **Performance Optimization:** Consider caching frequently computed scores or recommendations to improve responsiveness.

### Testing Strategy

**1. Unit Testing**  
• **Individual Rule Tests:** Create unit tests for each heuristic rule to ensure they behave as expected under various conditions.  
• **Edge Cases:** Test for edge cases (e.g., missing data, extreme values) to validate the robustness of each rule.

**2. Integration Testing**  
• **Component Interaction:** Validate the interaction between data ingestion, the heuristic engine, and output formatting. This ensures that data flows correctly through the system.  
• **Simulated User Scenarios:** Develop tests that simulate real user behaviors to check that the recommendation engine produces sensible outputs.

**3. Regression Testing**  
• **Continuous Integration:** Integrate regression tests into your CI/CD pipeline to catch any unintended changes in recommendation outcomes after modifications or rule adjustments.

**4. Performance and Load Testing**  
• **Scalability Tests:** As the recommendation engine might be part of a larger system, it’s important to test how it performs under various load conditions.  
• **Response Time Benchmarks:** Establish benchmarks to ensure that recommendations are generated within acceptable time limits, even as data volume grows.

### Transitioning to Machine Learning Later

• **Extensibility:** By keeping the heuristic engine modular and rule-driven, you create a solid baseline that can be used to compare performance against future ML-based approaches.  
• **Parallel Development:** Continue gathering data and user feedback that can later serve as training data for a machine learning model, ensuring a smoother transition when you’re ready to integrate ML methods.
